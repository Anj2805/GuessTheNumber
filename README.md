How the Game Works

-> Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 when the page loads.
-> User Input: The user enters a guess in the input field and clicks the "Guess" button.
-> Validation: The script checks if the input is a valid number within the specified range.
-> Feedback: The game provides feedback ("Try a higher number!" or "Try a lower number!") based on the user's guess. It also shows the number of attempts.
-> Winning Condition: When the user guesses the correct number, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the button is disabled to prevent further input.
